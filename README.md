# @bjf5201/tsdown-config

My custom, opinonated config functions to be used with the [`tsdown` build tool](https://tsdown.dev)

## tsdownLib

Basic library configs (these are extended by `tsdownNodeLib` and any other config functions in the future)

## tsdownNodeLib

Library configs specifically for `node` environment (vs `neutral` used in `tsdownLib` function)
